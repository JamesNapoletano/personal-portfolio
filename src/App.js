        Hello there. I'm James Napoletano. It seems as though you've stumbled
        upon my personal portfolio. On the navigation bar, at the top of the
        page, you'll see a number of links to other pages that make up this
        portfolio. Bio will lead you to my biography, Projects will lead you to
        my GitHub repositories and personal projects, Solved Problems will lead
        you to some solved coding problems, and Contact will assist you in
        getting ahold of me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Enjoy!
